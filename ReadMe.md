I actaually struggled with a lot things in this project, some of the ccs code i had to search it up on youtube in order for me to understand what i was doing. Im not going to lie in the begining i honest didn't know what was going on, but im starting to understand what is going on and looking more lively in the sessions and im proud of that.

And im going to continue reading the book that you told us we should read hopefully i will be able to understand NOT! everything but some of the functions in Code, but Overall the prject was good a bit stressing but after sometime comparing My Css and View Reference and changed up some things i managed to understand that this element works for this and it affects this. The color part is still confusing but i just used RGB not to stress myselt much, but yah im going to search the one with numbers and letters for better understanding

Design Choices 1,2&10

Project: SDF05

Im proud of the element (Box-shadow) because it is just 1 element but it make the appearance lot alot better
